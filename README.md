# Work in Progress
This is eventually going to turn into my dotfiles.
Due to my misunderstanding of git, i've created a repo that actively controls my nixos configuration live.

When I get to the point where I feel confortable with nix, and I get a working config up here, I'll move it to dotfiles and start including more configs.
