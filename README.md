# Work in Progress
This is eventually going to turn into my dotfiles.
Due to my misunderstanding of git, I've created a repo that actively controls my nixos configuration live. I'm not very good at this yet.

When I get to the point where I feel comfortable with nix and nixOS and I get a working config up here, I'll move it to dotfiles and start including more configs.

My eventual goal is to be able to control all of my nixOS deployments from here, and eventually my deployments of configs for Windows as well.
